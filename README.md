📦 Northwind-Database-MySQL
Welcome to Northwind-Database-MySQL! 🎉 This project is focused on setting up and working with the classic Northwind database in MySQL. The Northwind database is widely used for learning SQL concepts and practicing queries on a structured dataset. In this project, I have created SQL scripts, worked with JOINs, and explored different types of queries to analyze business data efficiently. 🛠️

📌 Features
✅ Database Creation – This project includes scripts to create the Northwind database from scratch in MySQL. 🏗️
✅ Table Structure – The database contains multiple relational tables, including Products, Orders, Customers, Employees, and Suppliers. 📊
✅ Data Insertion – The dataset is pre-loaded with sample data for testing and query execution. 🔄
✅ Joins & Queries – Includes multiple JOIN operations, GROUP BY queries, and other SQL techniques to retrieve meaningful business insights. 🔍
✅ ER Diagram – Visual representation of table relationships to understand the database structure. 📸

📂 Files in this Repository
📜 SQL Scripts – Contains all SQL scripts for creating the database, tables, and inserting sample data.
📸 Database Schema Diagram – ER diagram that illustrates the relationships between tables.
📘 Joins & Group By Queries – Includes different SQL queries to analyze customer orders, employee sales, product categories, and supplier details using JOINs and aggregations.

📌 The database consists of:

🏢 Customers – Stores customer information
📦 Orders – Contains details of customer orders
📋 Order Details – A junction table linking orders and products
📦 Products – List of products with supplier and category info
🚚 Suppliers – Supplier details for products
👩‍💼 Employees – Employee records
🚛 Shippers – Information about shipping companies
🔍 SQL Queries Used in This Project
This project explores different SQL queries, including:

✅ Basic Queries – Selecting data using SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY
✅ JOIN Queries – Combining data from multiple tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN
✅ Aggregation Queries – Using GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), and AVG()
✅ Filtering Data – Using WHERE conditions to retrieve specific records
✅ Sorting and Limiting Data – Ordering results and limiting output with ORDER BY and LIMIT
